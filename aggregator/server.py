# File Name: server.py
# Purpose: Aggregates model weights from multiple hospitals using 
# Federated Learning
# Date: 2025-03-21
# Description: This Flask server handles two main routes:
#              1. /upload: Receives model weights from individual hospitals
#              2. /aggregate: Aggregates the uploaded model weights 
#                 from multiple hospitals
#                 using Federated Averaging (FedAvg) 
#               and saves the resulting global model.
#
# Disclaimer: This is a demo application showcasing Federated Learning 
#             with synthetic data.
#             The model and system are built for educational 
#             purposes only and do not
#             reflect actual medical diagnostics or 
#            real-world healthcare data.
